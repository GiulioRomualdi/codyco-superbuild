# orocos_kdl and package kdl_codyco use export(PACKAGE <pkg>) that
# installs some files in ~/.cmake/packages/<pkg> that are used by cmake
# to locate the build directory for some packages.
# This messes up with the superbuild, because CMake will find the build
# directory, and therefore will not rebuild the package.
# Therefore we disable the package registry using
# NO_CMAKE_PACKAGE_REGISTRY
