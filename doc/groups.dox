* This is the list of CoDyCo modules in the repository.
* To add your own module to this list,
* just add a comment like the following anywhere in your source
* code (replacing "your_module_name" with the name of your module):
\verbatim
  /**
   *
   * \defgroup codyco_your_module_name your_module_name
   * @ingroup codyco_module
   *
   */
\endverbatim
*
* For convenience, try to keep the module name the same
* as the directory it is placed in.  If you've a good reason
* to do something different, of course you can do that too.
